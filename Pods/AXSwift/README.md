# AXSwift

AXSwift is a Swift wrapper for macOS's C-based accessibility client APIs. Working with these APIs is
error-prone and a huge pain, so AXSwift makes everything easier:

- Modern API that's 100% Swift
- Explicit error handling
- Complete coverage of the underlying C API
- Better documentation than Apple's, which is pretty poor

This framework is intended as a basic wrapper, and doesn't keep any state or do any "magic".
That's up to you!
